                We are the local embodiment of a Cosmos grown to selfawareness.
                We have begun to contemplate our origins: starstuff pondering
                the stars; organized assemblages of ten billion billion billion
                atoms considering the evolution of atoms; tracing the long
                journey by which, here at least, consciousness arose.
                Our loyalties are to the species and the planet. We speak for
                Earth. Our obligation to survive is owed not just to ourselves
                but also to that Cosmos, ancient and vast, from which we spring.

              <p>
                Consider again that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us.
                On it everyone you love, everyone you ever heard of, every
                human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate
                of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions,
                ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager,
                every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of
                civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in
                love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and
                explorer, every teather of morals, every corrupt politician,
                every "superstar", every "supreme leader", every saint and
                sinner in the history of our species lived there - on a mote of
                dust suspended in a sunbeam.
