# Carl Sagan Tribute

It's time to pivot into a new career!  I've started going through the courses at [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) and have come to the first project: [Build a Tribute Page](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-tribute-page).

After a night of overthinking, I decided to go with my first choice of Carl Sagan.  He's been a personal hero of mine ever since I was a child.

## Technology

This is a simple single page site.  It uses plain modern HTML5 and CSS.  It uses the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework's CSS classes to quickly layout the site.
